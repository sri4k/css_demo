        <span>Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits.</span>
        <span>They form a sister <span class="s">group</span> to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores.</span>
        <span>Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and </span>
        <span>bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Around 99% of living fish </span>
        <span>species are ray-finned <span class="s">fish</span> belonging to the class Actinopterygii, with over</span>
        <span>95% belonging to the teleost subgrouping.</span>

    <h2 id="h2">Etymology</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The word for fish in <span id="e">English</span> and the other Germanic languages (German fisch; Gothic fisks)
        is inherited from
        Proto-Germanic, and is related to the Latin piscis and Old Irish Ä«asc, though the exact root is unknown; some
        authorities reconstruct an Proto-Indo-European root *peysk-, attested only in Italic, Celtic, and Germanic.

        <p>
            Fish, as vertebrata, developed as sister of the tunicata. As the tetrapods emerged deep within the fishes
            group,
            as sister of the lungfish, characteristics of fish are typically shared by tetrapods, including having
            vertebrae
            and a cranium.
